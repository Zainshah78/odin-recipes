    <p>
      Banana bread is a type of bread made from mashed bananas. It is often a
      moist, sweet, cake-like quick bread; however there are some banana bread
      recipes that are traditional-style raised breads.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ cup butter</li>
      <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>2 ⅓ cups mashed overripe bananas</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 1</strong> <br />
      Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch
      loaf pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2</strong> <br />
      In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl,
      cream together butter and brown sugar. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas
      until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; stir just to
      moisten. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan. <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3</strong> <br />
      Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted
      into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let bread cool in pan for 10
      minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack.
