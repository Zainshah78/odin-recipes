    <p>
      A steak is a meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, potentially
      including a bone. It is normally grilled, though can also be pan-fried.
      Steak can also be cooked in sauce, such as in steak and kidney pie, or
      minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers.
